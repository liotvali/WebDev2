					<h2>Samosa Sweet Potatoes Wraps</h2>
					<p> <br><br>When we travel, we often make wraps to bring with us as a meal during our trip. They tend to be way more wholesome and delicious than the fast (and often expensive) options that are available at the airport or train station. <br><br> Like most of our dishes, it's all about the toppings, and I think it's a must to have some sliced avocado, or at least a creamy dressing like our cashew lime or avocado garlic cream. I also like my wraps to be a bit more spicy with a little squirt of sriracha or a dollop of our Afghan Green Chutney. <br><br> These savoury wraps are easy to make and assemble the night before, just pop them in the microwave the next morning, and you are good to go (adding the avocado after it's been heated, preferably)! You can also make the fillings ahead of time and assemble the next day. <br><br> INGREDIENTS: Sweet Potatoesbrbr <br>2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into <br> 1-inch cubes <br> 1/4 cup (40 g) frozen peas <br> 1 tsp (5 ml) coconut oil <br> 1/2 tsp ground cumin <br> 1/2 tsp ground coriander <br> 1/2 tsp turmeric powder <br>1/2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (optional) <br> Salt and pepper to taste <br><br> INGREDIENTS: Tofu Scramble <br> 1 block (225 g) medium, firm, or extra-firm tofu <br> 1 small onion, diced <br> 1 tsp (5 ml) coconut oil <br> 1 tsp turmeric <br> 1 tsp nutritional yeast <br> 1 tsp garlic powder <br> Salt and pepper to taste <br><br> INGREDIENTS: Wrap <br> Sliced red bell pepper <br> Sliced avocado <br> Whole wheat wraps</p>

					<h2>Frozen Yogurt Bars</h2>
					<p> <br><br> A way to eat yogurt with one hand! These bars have a subtle sweetness and are rather filling thanks to the almond butter, oats and yogurt. This is a great breakfast for those who: - prefer a lighter breakfast in the morning - need grab-n-go options for rushed mornings - prefer a cooler breakfast in the warmer months <br><br> INGREDIENTS 1 cup (about 12) pitted soft dates* <br> 2 cups (180 g) rolled oats (GF if preferred) <br> 1 cup (250 ml) almond butter <br> 1/4 cup (28 g) ground flaxseed <br> 1 tsp (5 g) ground cinnamon <br><br> 1.5 cups (375 ml) plant based-yogurt (we used soy) <br> 1 cup (100 g) frozen berries or fresh fruit, stewed <br><br> Optional Toppings <br> granola <br> sliced almonds <br> toasted coconut flakes <br><br> Directionsâ€‹ <br> First, stew the berries until soft, set aside to cool. <br> In a food processor, blend the dates until they are smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Add the oatmeal, ground flaxseed, almond butter, and cinnamon and combine, scraping down the sides once or twice. <br> Transfer the mix to a parchment lined baking dish and press the base into the dish. <br> Top with the yogurt and spread out evenly. <br> Dot the yogurt with the stewed berries and use a knife to swirl. <br> Place into the freezer and let freeze for 1-2 hours, or until the bars are solid enough to cut. <br> When removed from the freezer, cut into squares or bars of desired size. <br> Let thaw for 3-5 minutes before eating. <br> Enjoy!</p>

					<h2>Healthiest Ever Granola</h2>
